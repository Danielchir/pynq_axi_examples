    "This tutorial does not aim to teach the basics of HLS, Vivado and PYNQ, but rather to tie them together to show the full process of a design from C code to an overlay running on PYNQ. The files created at each major step can be found in <!-- wherever we put the files --> so you can feel free to skip through steps if you feel familiar with the content. \n",

    "Implementing this algorithm on an FPGA is very beneficial, thanks to the opportunities for parallelism. In each step, updating a value in the matrix does not require knowledge of any other value, which means we can compute all 16 values at the same time. This can reduce the latency of each step from 16+ clock cycles, to under 1 cycle each, if the designer chooses to prioritize the speed of the design, as we have done here. By comparison, a CPU would need to perform each operation in sequence. Despite a higher clock frequency, this results in a much slower output.\n",

    "\n",

All interface ports are bundled together into a single AXILite interface, even though the types of the arguments in C are different. In hardware, the same AXILite interface can be used to access the 128 bit integer key and the two 16 byte arrays. The 128 bit key is written to four 32 bit registers starting at offset `0x10`; the input and output arrays can be accessed in a similar way at addresses `0x30` and `0x40`. These offsets can be found in the software driver header file at `solution1 > impl > misc > drivers > aes_v1_0 > src`. You can also see how the 16 bytes of the input and output arrays are arranged into four 32 bit registers. \n",

    "\n",
    "These different types perform differently because of the way they are translated into hardware by HLS. Arrays are implemented as memory, meaning only one value will be accessed each clock cycle. The difference between them can be clearly seen in the _Schedule Viewer_, in the analysis view: the entire key is read in under a clock cycle, whereas each value in the array of plaintext inputs needs to be accessed individually.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Variations in endianness\n",
    "The notebook will run on Linux, which is a <!-- something --> endian system, but HLS will interpret data as being <!-- the other one --> endian. This means that byte order will be effectively swapped as data is sent to/from the IP. In many applications, this is not an issue so long as reads and writes operate in the same way. In the case of encryption, however, the result will be completely different if the IP tries to process 0x1234 instead of 0x4321. There are a few ways to handle this issue: \n",
    "* reorder the bytes in software directly so they get written to the PL in the right order\n",
    "* swap the byte order when reading in data into the PL\n",
    "* change the inner functions of the algorithm to account for the change in the ordering.\n",
