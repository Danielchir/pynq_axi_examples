    "# Creating a Design with Streams\n",

    "### Goal\n",
    "This tutorial follows the same steps as the previous tutorial, except using stream interfaces for the text input/output, rather than slave interfaces. Throughout the tutorial, some key differences between these will be highlighted.  \n",
    "\n",
    "AXI Stream is a protocol used to provide a steady flow of high speed data. Unlike with AXILite, there is no addressing involved here, as data is transfered directly from peer to peer."

    "## High Level Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the code will need to change as we switch to stream interfaces, it will be easier to work in a new project. \n",
    "Open Vivado HLS and create a new project; add the aes_stream.cpp source file, with _aes_ as the Top Function, as well as the testbench file, aes_stream_test.cpp. Select the part _xc7z020clg400-1_.\n",
    "\n",
    "![HLS Project Creation](./images_2/hls_prj.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changes in Code\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to write code to handle streams in HLS. Xilinx provides a stream class in HLS which can be used for designs written in C++, but you can also write streams yourself quite easily, as is done here. All we need for the tools to recognise a stream, is a `struct` which includes 3 signals: data, last, and user. These signals will be explained further in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "typedef struct{\n",
    "\tuint8_t data[16];\n",
    "\tap_uint<1> user;\t\t\n",
    "\tap_uint<1> last; \t    \n",
    "} stream_type;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The top level function is the only one which needs to change here, compared to when we were using axilite interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "* the function definition, of course, must change to use the two streams  \n",
    "```C\n",
    "void aes(ap_uint<128> key, stream_type* in_stream, stream_type* out_stream)\n",
    "```\n",
    "* the streams `in_stream` and `out_stream` can only be accessed once, meaning we cannot read or write each part of the `struct` individually. To limit the need to do this, we create buffer streams  \n",
    "```C\n",
    "stream_type input, output;\n",
    "input = *in_stream;\n",
    "output = input;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By copying `in_stream` into `input`, we are not only copying the data, but also the last and user signals. This ensures that these signals will also be set correctly in the output stream. \n",
    "* The rest of the code is identical to that in the other tutorial, except we pass only `input.data` and `output.data` to the read and write functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- changes in testbench! -->\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interface directives\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the previous version of this IP, the key will be transferred using the simple AXILite interface. Because this is a simple scalar, and only needs to be sent at the start, there is no need to complicate this. Changing the interface type of the input and output, however, will allows the IP to receive more data, faster. Double click on the `in_stream` variable in the directives panel. In the _mode_ drop-down menu, select _axis_ - this creates a stream interface. With this option, the struct we created will be interpreted by HLS as part of the AXI stream protocol. There are more signals in this protocol, but TLAST and TUSER are the only ones which need to be set manually, the rest will be included automatically during synthesis. Create an AXI stream interface for `out_stream` in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- return type, make sure it passes co-sim -->\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- depth?? if needed, specify that it's only for cosim! -->\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation and Synthesis\n",
    "Run the C Simulation to verify the result. Note that the order of the test patterns was changed; this is to account for a change in the way the arrays used in the Jupyter Notebook will be translated into hardware. As with the previous version of this example, we are aiming to obtain the correct result at the Notebook level, which requires some changes in the endianness in hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run Synthesis; as the _INFO_ statements appear in the console window, you can see all the directives which are being automatically applied to reach II=1. When the synthesis report opens, scroll down to the interface summary. Here you can see the port which are being added. For each stream, we have:  \n",
    "* data: contains the data in blocks of 128 bits (equivalent to our array of 16 bytes). \n",
    "* last: this signal indicates the last 128 bit block being sent. It is set to 1 when the last block is being sent, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "* ready: this signal goes high whenever the IP is ready to take in more data. As we have an initiation interval (ii) of 1 in this case, ready should stay high for the duration of the transaction. If we had ii=2, it would toggle between 0 and 1 on every cycle.\n",
    "* valid: this signal goes high every time the data associated with it is valid. This avoids intermediate data being falsely interpreted.\n",
    "* user can be used for a user defined part of the protocol, but will not be used here.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mechanism can be seen clearly in this example from the [AXI User Guide](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/ip_documentation/ug761_axi_reference_guide.pdf#page=63&zoom=100,0,397):\n",
