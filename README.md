# PYNQ AXI Examples

This repository contains three tutorials discussing the AXI interfaces, and show how they can be used in hardware designs with PYNQ.
All three tutorials are based on a C++ implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard.

Tutorial 1: AXILite
Tutorial 2: AXI Stream
Tutorial 3: Full AXI

For each tutorial, all explanations are contained in the iPython notebook. HLS Code can be found in the hls_code directory for each tutorial, and bitstreams are already provided in the bitstream file.

To install this repository on your PYNQ board, open a terminal and run:

Currently this repository is compatible with PYNQ image v2.4, on PYNQ-Z1 and PYNQ-Z2.
